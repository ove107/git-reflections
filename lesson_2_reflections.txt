How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Ans: *I can now use >git diff< to check the differences between files that have been changed but not yet added.
	 *I can use <git diff --staged< to see the differences between staged files and un staged to confirm that these are
	 	infact the changes you want to commit.
